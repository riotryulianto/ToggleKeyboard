# ToggleKeyboard
Windows command prompt script to enable or disable the internal laptop keyboard.

## How it works
This script works by toggling the autostart of the **PS/2 Driver (i8042prt)** the laptop keyboard uses. (disabled/auto)
The laptop will restart after the script has been run. This script needs to **'Run as administrator'** to function.
